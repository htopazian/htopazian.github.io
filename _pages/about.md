I am a post-doctoral research associate in <a href='https://www.imperial.ac.uk/malaria-modelling/'>malaria epidemiology</a> at Imperial College London. I use individual-based stochastic and deterministic models to test new and existing interventions for malaria control and elimination.

Prior to starting my post-doc I completed my PhD in Epidemiology with the <a href='https://www.med.unc.edu/medicine/infdis/ideel'>Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Ecology Lab</a> at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and my Master's in Epidemiology from the <a href='https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/epidemiology/'>Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health</a>. 

I have also spent time living abroad in Kenya and Malawi, working with the U.S. National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Center for Global Health, national Ministries of Health, and other academic partners on HIV, sickle cell disease, Burkitt's lymphoma, esophageal cancer, cervical cancer, and the RTS,S malaria vaccine. Currently, I serve as an epidemiology consultant for the <a href='https://paacs.net/'>Pan African Academy of Christian Surgeons (PAACS)</a> and as a member of the <a href='https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/esophagus/afrecc'>African Esophageal Cancer Consortium (AfrECC)</a> and the <a href='https://ammnet.org/'>Applied Malaria Modeling Network (AMMnet)</a>.
