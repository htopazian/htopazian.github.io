I am a post-doctoral research associate in malaria epidemiology at Imperial College London. 
Prior to my post-doc I worked on HIV, sickle cell disease, Burkitt’s lymphoma, cervical cancer, and the RTS,S malaria vaccine. 
I completed my PhD in Epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and my Master's from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 
I have spent time living abroad in Kenya and Malawi, working with the U.S. National Cancer Institute’s Center for Global Health, national Ministries of Health, and other academic partners. I also serve as an epidemiology consultant for the Pan African Academy of Christian Surgeons (PAACS) and a member of the African Esophageal Cancer Consortium (AfrECC).
